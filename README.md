dotfiles

most of my important dotfiles.

folders must be joined into your .config/ file in your home. (13, 13status and openbox)

while .Xdefaults is depreciated, it still works as of today and can easily be ported into .Xressources if you must do so.

most of .bashrc alias won't work without the software installed

.xmobarrc will work properly ONLY IF you compile it using the audio flag (get from AUR on arch linux OR get from haskell repo).
